Welcome to the Day 1 of learning Dynamic Deployment. In this tutorial we will learn concepts of Docker and Docker Swarm with the help of Python microservices. In this hands-on tutorial, you will:
- Containerize Python application using Docker.
- Establish communication between multiple containers.
- Use Docker Compose to manage multi-container application on a single machine.
- Deploy the same setup on multiple Raspberry Pis using Docker Swarm.
- Understand orchestration by comparing Docker Compose and Docker Swarm.
