# When we run this file, the docker will:
# - Use the base image python:3.9 from docker hub. This file includes Python 3.9 and a minimal OS such as Alpine. 
# - Inside the container we choose the directory /app as the working directory. All the subsequent commands will be executed in this directory. 
#   If the directory don't exist docker will create it.
# - Next, we'll copy "producer.py" program to /app directory (copying the program from host machine to the container).
# - Installing the dependencies (in this case we only have one: flask).
# - Finally, executing the program in the container.
